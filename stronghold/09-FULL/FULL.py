Inferring Peptide from Full Spectrum
====================================

Say that we have a string s containing t as an internal substring, so that
there exist nonempty substrings s1 and s2 of s such that s can be written as
s1ts2. A t-prefix contains all of s1 and none of s2; likewise, a t-suffix
contains all of s2 and none of s1.

Given: A list L containing 2n+3 positive real numbers (nâ‰¤100).  The first
number in L is the parent mass of a peptide P, and all other numbers represent
the masses of some b-ions and y-ions of P (in no particular order). You may
assume that if the mass of a b-ion is present, then so is that of its
complementary y-ion, and vice-versa.

Return: A protein string t of length n for which there exist two positive real
numbers w1 and w2 such that for every prefix p and suffix s of t, each of
w(p)+w1 and w(s)+w2 is equal to an element of L. (In other words, there exists
a protein string whose t-prefix and t-suffix weights correspond to the
non-parent mass values of L.) If multiple solutions exist, you may output any
one.
