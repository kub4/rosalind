Perfect Matchings and RNA Secondary Structures
==============================================

Given an RNA string s=s1â€¦sn, a bonding graph for s is formed as follows. First,
assign each symbol of s to a node, and arrange these nodes in order around a
circle, connecting them with edges called adjacency edges. Second, form all
possible edges {A, U} and {C, G}, called basepair edges.

Note that a matching contained in the basepair edges will represent one
possibility for base pairing interactions in s, as shown in Figure 5. For such
a matching to exist, s must have the same number of occurrences of 'A' as 'U'
and the same number of occurrences of 'C' as 'G'.

Given: An RNA string s of length at most 80 bp having the same number of
occurrences of 'A' as 'U' and the same number of occurrences of 'C' as 'G'.

Return: The total possible number of perfect matchings of basepair edges in the
bonding graph of s.
