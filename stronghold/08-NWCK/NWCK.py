Distances in Trees
==================

Given: A collection of n trees (nâ‰¤40) in Newick format, with each tree
containing at most 200 nodes; each tree Tk is followed by a pair of nodes xk
and yk in Tk.

Return: A collection of n positive integers, for which the kth integer
represents the distance between xk and yk in Tk.
