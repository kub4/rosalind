Matching Random Motifs
======================

Given: A positive integer Nâ‰¤100000, a number x between 0 and 1, and a DNA
string s of length at most 10 bp.

Return: The probability that if N random DNA strings having the same length as
s are constructed with GC-content x, then at least one of the strings equals s.
We allow for the same random string to be created more than once. A random
string is constructed so that the probability of choosing each subsequent
symbol is based on a fixed underlying symbol frequency.
