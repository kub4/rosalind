"""
Newick Format with Edge Weights
===============================

Given: A collection of n weighted trees (nâ‰¤40) in Newick format, with each tree
containing at most 200 nodes; each tree Tk is followed by a pair of nodes xk
and yk in Tk.

Return: A collection of n numbers, for which the kth number represents the
distance between xk and yk in Tk.
