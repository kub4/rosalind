"""
Expected Number of Restriction Sites
====================================

Given: A positive integer n (nâ‰¤1,000,000), a DNA string s of even length
at most 10, and an array A of length at most 20, containing numbers
between 0 and 1.

Return: An array B having the same length as A in which B[i] represents
the expected number of times that s will appear as a substring of a random
DNA string t of length n, where t is formed with GC-content A[i].
