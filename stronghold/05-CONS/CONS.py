"""
Consensus and Profile
=====================

Say that we have a collection of DNA strings, all having the same length n.
Their profile matrix is a 4Ã—n matrix P in which P1,j represents the number of
times that 'A' occurs in the j-th position of one of the strings, P2,j
represents the number of times that C occurs in the j-th position, and so on.

A consensus string c is a string of length n formed from our collection by
taking the most common symbol at each position; the j-th symbol of c therefore
corresponds to the symbol having the maximum value in the j-th column of the
profile matrix. Of course, there may be more than one most common symbol,
leading to multiple possible consensus strings.

Given: A collection of at most 10 DNA strings of equal length (at most 1 kbp)
in FASTA format.

Return: A consensus string and profile matrix for the collection. (If several
possible consensus strings exist, then you may return any one of them.)
