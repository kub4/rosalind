"""
Matching a Spectrum to a Protein
================================

The complete spectrum of a weighted string s is the multiset S[s]
containing the weights of every prefix and suffix of s.

Given: A positive integer n followed by a collection of n protein strings s1,
s2, ..., sn and a multiset R of positive numbers (corresponding to the complete
spectrum of some unknown protein string).

Return: The maximum multiplicity of RâŠ–S[sk] taken over all strings sk, followed
by the string sk for which this maximum multiplicity occurs (you may output any
such value if multiple solutions exist).
