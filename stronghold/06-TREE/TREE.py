Completing a Tree
=================

An undirected graph is connected if there is a path connecting any two nodes.
A tree is a connected (undirected) graph containing no cycles; this definition
forces the tree to have a branching structure organized around a central core
of nodes, just like its living counterpart.

In the creation of a phylogeny, taxa are encoded by the tree's leaves, or nodes
having degree 1. A node of a tree having degree larger than 1 is called an
internal node.

Given: A positive integer n (nâ‰¤1000) and an adjacency list corresponding to
a graph on n nodes that contains no cycles.

Return: The minimum number of edges that can be added to the graph to produce
a tree.
